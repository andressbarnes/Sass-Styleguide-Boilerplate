## Sass Boilerplate Features
### Colors 
 - Colors are indexed in `_colors.scss` and the swatches are compiled using a `@each` loop that assigns the class and a background color which can be used anywhere.
 
### Body Styles
 - Headline styles defined `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and `h4`
 
### Text Styles
 - Hyperlinks, Paragraph, Strong, Italic, etc
 
## Example Project "Website Styleguide"
 - This imports the `styles.css` for the base styles and `styleguide.css` which has specific styles for the project
