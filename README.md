## Sass Boilerplate Features
### Colors 
 - Colors are indexed in `_colors.scss` and the swatches are compiled using a `@each` loop that assigns the class and a background color which can be used anywhere.
 
## Example Project "Website Styleguide"
 - This imports the `styles.css` for the base styles and `styleguide.css` which has specific styles for the project
